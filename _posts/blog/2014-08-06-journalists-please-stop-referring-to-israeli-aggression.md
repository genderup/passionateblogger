With so much <del>conflict</del>, <del>violence</del>, <del>war</del>, <a href="http://gawker.com/here-is-an-israeli-paper-column-titled-when-genocide-i-1614631309">genocide</a> happening in Gaza over the last month, opportunity has arisen to evaluate the language used by media to describe the events taking place. Fortunately, a handbook exists to help journalists with just that.

In October, 2013, the <a href="http://www.freemedia.at/">International Press Institute</a> published <a href="http://www.freemedia.at/publications/other-publications/use-with-care.html">"Use With Care: A Reporter's Glossary of Loaded Language in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict"</a> that was the product of a collaboration (of sorts) mediated by the IPI between three Israeli and three Palestinian journalists who sought to identify loaded terminology used to describe the conflict and also to agree upon more suitable alternatives where possible. In the words of its editor Naomi Hunt, the handbook tries to "explain how different terms affect how audiences perceive the conflict." The handbook was compiled by asking three Palestinian journalists to identify words they found objectionable with the same being done by three Israeli journalists. 

Hunt was talking about <i>Use With Care</i> on CBC radio this week <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/q/episodes/">(August 4, 2014)</a>. At the 13:00 minute mark of the interview she has an exchange with the interviewer where she laments the continued use of the phrase "Israeli aggression":

Hunt: 
<blockquote>And yes we'd hope our book has an impact in getting people to reconsider the terms that they use.</blockquote>

Interviewer:  
<blockquote>And what are some of the terms that are still being used out there?</blockquote>

Hunt: 
<blockquote>Well, there's several of them, but just sort of, two examples. On the one hand, I've seen several references to "Israeli aggression," which in our book is decided as being loaded because there's a view that the word "aggression" delegitimizes IDF actions that the IDF would argue are a legitimate response to violence from the other side.</blockquote>

At the time of publication of this blog post, there were more than 1800 Palestinian deaths (and almost 10,000 injured) over the last month compared to fewer than 60 Israeli deaths.  

According to the handbook, Israelis feel like they're being blamed when the word "aggression" is used:

<blockquote>
There is an Israeli view that this word is problematic when used as a blanket description for Israeli military operations, such as an air strike or broader military assault, because it immediately assigns blame; however, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) might argue that the operation was carried out against a specific person who is involved in attacks against Israel, and who they,
therefore, consider a legitimate target. For example: ‘Hamas condemned Israeli aggression in Gaza’.
Journalists should consider using the terms strike / military operation or military assault.
(See also: targeted (strike); surgical (action))
</blockquote>


Keep up the good work!
