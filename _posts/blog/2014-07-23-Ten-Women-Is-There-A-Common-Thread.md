In 2011, I noticed that the @Wikileaks Twitter account had well over half a million followers, but that it wasn't following anyone itself. There was a big <b>0</b> underneath its "following" count. (These days, if you're not following anyone, Twitter <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10328969/inter-wikileaks.png" target="_blank">doesn't show</a> a "following" count, let alone a 0). Not following anyone seemed like a symbolic and powerful expression of independence by the activist organization, but also pratical. Leaks rather than tweets are what Wikileaks really cares about so there doesn't seem to be a reason to follow anyone on Twitter.

For small organizations with employees, the strategy used by the software firm Basecamp (@37Signals) seems very effective. @37Signals only follows members of its team, as well as the Twitter account for its digital magazine @thedistance. That's it. There might be some marketing or symbolic value to this strategy but it's also very practical as it gives customers another way to find someone to help you with Basecamp software. But wait a minute. @Jamis, one of Basecamp's longest-serving engineers <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3754-what-jamis-left-behind-for-us">recently resigned</a>, and he's still followed by @37Signals. Did @37Signals neglect to unfollow him, or does it still follow him because the Basecamp team <a href="http://blogcabin.37signals.com/posts/3754-what-jamis-left-behind-for-us">loves</a> him? Or is there another reason?

Once an organization starts following more than just its employees, it becomes harder to make sense of what its 'following' strategy is, or if it even has one. Harder, but not impossible. Twitter provides <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api">some tools</a> to help in this regard. I took a look at the Twitter account for @the_intercept, the digital magazine founded by journalist Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) of Edward Snowden fame. It became active in February, 2014 and the data used in this blog post (using the <a href="https://github.com/sferik/twitter" target="_blank">Twitter gem</a>) was collected by July 14, 2014. 

@The_intercept has 65,900 followers, but it only follows 398 people. This blog post focusses on those 398 people, and why and when they were followed by @the_intercept. Twitter doesn't tell you <i>when</i> each user was followed (yesterday, three months ago?), but it does tell you the order in which users were followed, which can be very revealing, and, in the case of @the_intercept, it is very revealing. It also obviously doesn't tell you <i>why</i> each user was followed, but you can form conclusions from patterns and other known information.  One thing I noticed was that, among the 398 Twitter accounts followed by @the_intercept, a common thread united <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10328969/10women.png" target="_blank">these 10 women</a>. Something also distinguished them from other women, men and organizations followed by @the_intercept. (If you want to figure it out yourself, stop reading and start <a href="https://github.com/sferik/twitter">exploring </a>, then come back to compare your theory with mine.)

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10328969/10women.png" class="image-center">

<h2>The Team Phase: 1 - 13</h2>

Some of @the_intercept's following activity is very obvious. Like @37Signals, @the_intercept follows its team.  The first thirteen people followed by @the_intercept were in some way associated professionally with @the_intercept or its parent company First Look Media. Some more members of the team were added at random points later on.

As I scrolled casually through @the_intercept's following page (for example, <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10328969/intercept-females-1%20copy.png">here,</a><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10328969/intercept-females-2.png">here</a>and <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10328969/intercept-females-3.png">here</a>), it seemed like @the_intercept followed a lot of accounts run by women, specifically female journalists. Knowing that the founders and editor of the magazine had spoken out about the importance of diversity, I wonderered whether this somehow got expressed in the users @the_intercept followed on Twitter. 

<h2>Gender</h2> 

Most people don't bother stating their gender in their Twitter profile, so it was up to me to make this determination (sometimes by clicking links to websites in Twitter profiles, sometimes just relying on profile pics), which can lead to mistakes and misunderstandings.  Since I had already concluded that @the_intercept was following its staff <i>because</i> they were associated professionally with the company, I wanted to keep team members separate but I still note their gender in the small print below. Even if there are a few inaccuracies, I feel fairly confident asserting that on the whole @the_intercept is following a lot more women than men, as well as more organizational accounts:

<div class="charto" style="width:800px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">
  <h4 style="width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">Followed by @The_Intercept</h4>

       <div class="pinko" style="width: 394px;  margin-right: 71px;">197<div class="ejectors">females</div></div>
       <div class="blueo" style="width: 266px;">133<div class="ejectors">males</div></div>
       <div class="greyo" style="width: 101px;">50<div class="ejectors">organizations </div></div>
      <div class="greeno" style=" width: 26px; margin-right: 57px;">18<div class="ejectors">employees*</div></div> 
      <small>*14 male, 3 female, plus the organziation account for @firstlook 1 org</small>
</div>
 
These numbers become more interesting when you look at the order in which the users were followed.  Although @the_intercept follows many more women than men, it didn't start out that way. After the Team phase, the next 197 users followed--from the 14th to 211th follow--show a heavy bias towards men:

<div class="charto" style="width:800px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">
  <h4 style="width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">14th to 211th follow by @the_intercept</h4>
       <div class="blueo" style="width: 226px;">113<div class="ejectors">males</div></div>
       <div class="pinko" style="width: 88px;  margin-right: 71px;">44<div class="ejectors">females</div></div>
       <div class="greyo" style="width: 78px;">39<div class="ejectors">organizations</div></div>
       <div class="greeno" style=" width: 2px; margin-right: 57px;">1<div class="ejectors">employee*</div></div> 
       <small>*@jayrosen_nyu, a First Look Advisor</small> 
</div>

Of course, this must mean that of the final 186 Twitter users followed by @the_intercept the vast majority are female.

<div class="charto" style="width:800px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">
  <h4 style="width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">212th to 398th follow by @the_Intercept</h4>
       <div class="pinko" style="width: 306px;  margin-right: 71px;">153<div class="ejectors">females</div></div>
       <div class="blueo" style="width: 40px;">20<div class="ejectors">males</div></div>
       
       
       <div class="greyo" style="width: 24px;">12<div class="ejectors">organizations</div></div>
      <div class="greeno" style=" width: 4px; margin-right: 57px;">2<div class="ejectors">*employees</div></div>  
      <small>*@johnjcook and @pierre</small>
</div>

So, viewing the gender of account holders together with the order in which they were followed reveals some interesting patterns, but what does it all mean and how to find that out? 

<h2>Finding Users To Follow</h2>

I compared the 'following' list for @the_intercept against the users followed by other members of @the_intercept team, as well as First Look Media's Andy Carvin @acarvin. Carvin has stated his job is to <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/238322/andy-carvin-joins-first-look-media/">collaborate with the public on a more fundamental level across its operations</a>, which I thought might include Twitter since he used Twitter a lot in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slkJB_PIu24" target="_blank">former role</a>at NPR.

After the initial Team phase ended and up until the 211th follow--from 14 to 211--one key data point stands out.  Everyone followed by @the_intercept during this second phase is also followed by @jeremyscahill, who is one of @the_intercept's three founders. For lack of a better term, I call this "the Scahill streak" to refer to the consecutive number (198) of people followed by @the_intercept who are also followed by @jeremyscahill. 

<div style="width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto">
    <table>
    <caption style="color: #083095; font-size: 18px"><h4>Phase 1 and 2 of @the_intercept following activity</h4></caption>
<tr>
  <th>Phase</th>

  <th>Why/Context in which they were followed</th>

  <td>selected users (vast majority male) followed by @the_intercept founder @jeremyscahill

</table>
</div>

Following users followed by a member of the team--especially a founding member of the team--is a quick and easy way to find users appropriate for the organizational account, especially an organization like @the_intercept which has a strong association with the personality of its journalists. But the Scahill streak abruptly ends, even when he had so many more users to follow (he follows more than 2,700 people on Twitter). What happened?

For its 212th follow, @the_intercept followed the Financial Times columnist <a href="https://twitter.com/najmeh_tehran">@najmeh_tehran</a>, who isn't followed by @jeremyscahill. In fact of the next 20 users followed by @the_intercept, only one is followed by @jeremyscahill, making it clear that if @the_intercept had been using @jeremyscahill's 'following page' as a source for accounts to follow, it stopped doing so after it had followed 211 users.  From this point forward, the overwhelming ratio (7.65 to 1) of users followed by @the_intercept are women.  

<h4>The Transition Period- 212 to 244</h4>

From the 212th follow to the 244th follow, there is what I call a transition period. @the_intercept selects mostly female users to follow, but do so almost randomly, in that there doesn't appear to be any kind of streak, where users are followed from one team member's acount.  This is the most interesting period of activity, both in the sense that @the_intercept is transitioning to following primarily female users, but also that it is searching for a new strategy to find users to follow. I will return to this transition period momentarily to answer the question, What do <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10328969/10women.png" target="_blank">these 10 women</a> have in common? 

<img class="image-center" src="/10women.png">

<h4>The Greewnald streak</h4>

From the 244th follow to the 296th follow, a new streak emerges, a Glenn Greenwald streak, where every user (52 consecutive users) followed by @the_intercept is also followed by @ggreenwald. @The_intercept is now using Greenwald's account to source mostly female users to follow. Then there's a break where one user followed by @the_intercept isn't followed by @ggreenwald, and a new mini streak starts where 9 consecutive users followed by @the_intercept are also followed by @ggreenwald. 

<h4>The Andy Carvin streak</h4>

Then from the 307th user to the 392nd user, there is a 85 user streak where every user followed by @the_intercept is also followed by @acarvin. After that 6 more users are followed, 2 of them employees, one of them the parody account of the Intercept (@the_intercept_ , with an extra underscore), as well as three others.

</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h4>What happens in the Transition Period?</h4>

What happened during the break after the Scahill streak end and before the Greenwald and Carvin streaks began, and why is it so interesting? 

Comparing the complete list of users (all 398 of them) followed by @the_interept against lists of users followed by staff of @the_intercept and First Look Media (such as @acarvin), it seems that <i>almost</i> every user followed by @the_intercept is followed by at least one member of The Intercept team or First Look media. Emphasis on almost.  There are 12 Twitter accounts followed by @the_intercept that are not followed by at least one other person who works for @the_intercept or First Look Media.  

Who are they and why are they followed? 

These are the 10 women, plus a parody account (@the_intercept_, which was followed very late), and another account that gives no indication about gender, so I classify it as an organization based on its name <a href="https://twitter.com/persianyouth">persian youth</a>. I also classify @the_intercept_ parody account as an organizational account, which it most certainly isn't. 

<div class="charto" style="width:800px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">
  <h4 style="width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">Followed By @The_Intercept But Not Other Intercept or First Look Employees</h4>
  <div class="pinko" style="width: 20px;  margin-right: 71px;">10<div class="ejectors">females</div></div>
   <div class="greyo" style="width: 2px; text-align: center;">2<div class="ejectors">org</div></div>         
</div>

The most interesting aspect of these 10 women (plus @persianyouth) is <i>when</i> they were followed by @the_intercept. They (as well as the @persianyouth account) were followed <i>after</i> the @jeremyscahill phase ended but <i>before</i> the @ggreenwald and @acarvin streaks began. I suggest that the timing is significant. At this point in time it was decided that @the_intercept should primarily follow accounts run by women to rectify the gender imbalance created by selecting users from the @jeremyscahill account, but a strategy wasn't yet formed how to do it (i.e. they hadn't yet decided to pluck users from @ggreenwald's account) so random female journalists were followed, with little regard to whether it actually makes sense to follow these journalists from other established critieria--namely, are they followed by anyone else on the team.

<h2>Engagement</h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slkJB_PIu24" target="_blank"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10328969/andy-carvin-retweet-revolution.png"></a>

At some point in the process of following users, @the_intercept adopted a "diversity" strategy about following users and to rectify a gender imbalance created when selecting users to follow from the @jeremyscahill account. Let's look at how @the_intercept engages with the users it follows. 

I obtained a list of all the Twitter users that had been retweeted (by hitting the retweet button only) by @the_intercept, then I compared it against the list of users followed by @the_intercept.  I was interested not only in how many of the people followed by @the_intercept had been rewtweeted, but also how many people had been retweeted by @the_intercept who are <i>not</i> followed by @the_intercept. There is actually many more of the latter than the former.  97 different Twitter users have been retweeted by @the_intercept who are not followed @the_intercept, and they've sometimes been retweeted multiple times. Here's the gender breakdown. It turns out the vast majority are male:

<div class="charto" style="width:800px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">
  <h4 style="width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">Retweeted But Not Followed By @The_Intercept</h4>
       <div class="blueo" style="width: 110px;">55<div class="ejectors">males</div></div>
       <div class="greyo" style="width: 60px;">30<div class="ejectors">organizations</div></div>
       <div class="pinko" style="width: 24px;  margin-right: 71px;">12<div class="ejectors">females</div></div>   
</div>

So how does it happen that @the_intercept retweets a lot of users (both men and women) it doesn't follow? Probably someone on @the_intercept team notices a tweet in their personal timeline, and then decides it should be retweeted by @the_intercept. It's obviously not necessary for @the_intercept to follow that user for the retweet to happen, and the @the_intercept isn't deciding to follow users after they are retweeted. For example, @jameeljaffer has been retweeted 9 times by @the_intercept but is not followed by @the_intercept. This only shows that following a user isn't a precondition for engaging with that user, which I would suggest is relevant to evaluating the reason why @the_intercept followed so many accounts run by women. 

So how much engagement has there been with users who are followed by @the_intercept. Of the 153 females followed by @the_intercept during its push to follow more females, three of them had been retweeted by @the_intercept.  Of the 20 males followed by @the_intercept during the diversity push, three have also been retweeted (some of them multiple times).  

<div class="charto" style="width:800px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">
  <h4 style="width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">Engagement with final 187 users Followed by @The_Intercept</h4>
       <div class="pinko" style="width: 306px;  margin-right: 71px;">153<div class="ejectors">females</div></div>
       <div class="pinko" style="width: 6px;  margin-right: 71px;">3<div class="ejectors"> retweeted</div></div>
       <div class="blueo" style="width: 40px;">20<div class="ejectors">males</div></div>
        <div class="blueo" style="width: 6px;">3<div class="ejectors">retweeted</div></div>
       
       
       <div class="greyo" style="width: 24px;">12<div class="ejectors">organizations</div></div>
       <div class="greyo" style="width: 2px;">retweeted<div class="ejectors">organizations</div></div>
      <div class="greeno" style=" width: 4px; margin-right: 57px;">2<div class="ejectors">employees</div></div>
      <div class="greeno" style=" width: 2px; margin-right: 57px;">1 <div class="ejectors"> retweeted</div></div>  
</div>

Which three were retweeted? None of the 10 women (nor @persianyouth) not followed by anyone on the team have been retweeted, which probably isn't much of a surprise. If no one on @the_intercept team follows any of them, it's much harder to know if they've tweeted something interesting.  Of the 88 females added during "the @acarvin streak," none of them have been retweeted.  

The 3 women added during the gender diversity push who have been retweeted were followed during the @ggreenwald streak. These are JanineGibson, HinaShamsi and RuthS (an editor at the Guardian).  It's undisputed that these women and all the women followed <i>by @ggreenwald</i> are held in high regard by Greenwald, but they were followed <i>by @the_intercept</i> as part of a diversity push motivated, it seems, by a need to rectify the gender imbalance created by  following users from @jeremyscahill's account. The fact that a couple of @ggreenwald's follows were retweeted doesn't change the purpose for which they were added. They could have just as easily been left unfollowed by @the_intercept and retweeted by it, as could have any of the users followed by @the_intercept, which engages mostly with users it doesn't follow.  Made when he worked at NPR, Carvin's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slkJB_PIu24" target="_blank">statement</a>--"The act of retweeting the revolution impacts the revolution"--is insightful in this context because, for the gender revolution, the act of merely following a user is an empty gesture, and probably also an insulting one if it was motivated by a desire to cover up an embarassing situation.

For the sake of completion, let's see how many of the users followed by @the_intercept have been retweeted.  7 of the 113 (6%) male users had been retweeted, while 1 of the 44 female (2%) users had been retweeted

</div>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

After following its team, @the_intercept followed users followed by @jeremyscahill until it seems someone realized that a unsightly gender imbalance had been created. One wonders whether someone considered unfollowing some of those users added during the Scahill streak, but that could be awkward couldn't it? Did  someone then give the order to wallpaper over the problem by following primarily female users from that point forward, abandoning temporarily the other criterion (which may never have been explicitly stated to be a criterion) for adding new users--namely, that they be followed by at least one other member of the team. The Intercept returned to this strategy once it started following primarily female users from the accounts of @acarvin and @ggreenwald (whose excellent book <i>No Place To Hide</i> I reviewed <a href="http://discussthetimes.com/blog/nsa/no-place-to-hide-greenwald-edward-snowden/">here</a>).

Does @the_intercept's activity on Twitter inspire confidence that it and its parent company First Look Media can become <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/244065/why-journalism-startups-should-look-past-traditional-talent-pools/" target="_blank"> more diverse than every other media organization of similar size and stature</a> If you were one of the 10 women (or @persianyouth) followed only it seems as part of a diversity push and, unlike anyone else followed by @the_intercept, with no other connection to the Intercept team would you be insulted? Is it a non issue, or would you maybe be grateful to @the_intercept and whatever network effects its follow created?  At the end of the day, Twitter is about accumulating followers. They all got followed by @the_intercept as well as everyone who looks to @the_intercept for inspiration about who to follow. And hey, if you liked this story,  why not follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/discussthetimes">@DiscussTheTimes</a> but please only if you really mean it.
