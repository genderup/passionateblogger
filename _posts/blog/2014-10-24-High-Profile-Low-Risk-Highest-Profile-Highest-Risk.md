On the morning of Wednesday, October 22, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau went to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the National War Memorial in Ottawa where he shot and killed Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. After attempting to kill a second reservist guarding the Tomb, Zehalf-Bibeau made his way in a beige vehicle and then on foot to Parliament where he hijacked a minister's vehicle to drive the last few hundred meters to his final destination, the Centre Block of Parliament, which he entered and where he was killed before he could take any more life. 

Zehaf-Bibeau would have been under no illusions about the impossibility of escaping from the Centre Block of Parliament after opening fire. Even though it obviously had weak security, the building is filled and surrounded by armed police and military who would close in on him. From the terrorist's perspective, the final target of Zehalf-Bibeau's plot was a very high risk and high reward proposition. He would make an attempt on the highest profile members of goverment but also certainly not escape alive.

Had Zehaf-Bibeau's plot been restricted to attacking the Centre Block of Parliament, his attempt would have been a dramatic failure. After all, he was killed inside Parliament without being able to inflict any harm.  Anyone considering such a plot would know this was likely to be the case and, therefore, prior to his attacks on Parliament, Zehaf-Bibeau made plans to attack another high profile location but one which also represented a very low risk for himself, at least to the extent that he would have an opportunity to get away and make his attempt on Parliament. He would kill the soldiers guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Solider.  As part of their duties in front of the Tomb, these soldiers carried unloaded weapons, and are required to stand in a way that makes them entirely defenseless to such an attack. By beginning his attack here, Zehaf-Bibeau essentially obtained insurance that, whatever happened at his final high-risk high-reward destination, he would at least be able to inflict some measure of significant harm.  While <a href="https://twitter.com/rj_gallagher/status/525101666149085184">theories emerge</a> that Zehaf-Bibeau was merely an unhinged mental health patient with a history of criminal delinquincy (but not, by implication, a actual hardcore Islamist terrorist), his actions on October 22, 2014 reflect a calculated attempt to carry out a lasting terrorist attack against his country.
