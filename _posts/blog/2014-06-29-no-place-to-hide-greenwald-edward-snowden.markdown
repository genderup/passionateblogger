It's in the fourth chapter of his intriguing new book <i>No Place to Hide</i> that journalist Glenn Greenwald faces his most important challenge: persuading the reader of the harm of surveillance. The first two chapters draw us in with the story of how Greenwald and Laura Poitras come into possession of the Snowden documents. The third chapter--<i>Collect It All</i>--describes the extraordinary surveillance machinery at the disposal of the NSA.  But what harm, if any, does surveillance pose and, by implication, is that harm greater than any benefit it might offer? Greenwald calls this "the vital question."

In answering his question, Greenwald presents a thesis that deserves treatment in a full-length study of American history: that we are bound in a type of contract with the government (which we did not voluntarily enter) in which we are only assured of being "left alone" if we remain quiet and unthreatening, and where any type of challenge to its power will be viewed as "wrongdoing." Greenwald provides a list of individuals and organizations which, for the crime of representing a mere dissenting opinion, have been spied on and subjected to "dirty tricks" by the U.S. government.  However, "dirty tricks," as Greenwald calls them, is a slight understatement to describe the unethical and illegal tactics the U.S. government has used against dissenters. Just consider, for example, what documents obtained during a 1981 break in of an FBI branch in Pennsylvania revealed. As part of its domestic counterintelligence program Cointelpro, the FBI had infiltrated subversive political groups--such as the Natioanl Association for the Advancement of Colored People--and attempted to induce its members into committing criminal acts so that the FBI could arrest and prosecute them. 

How terrifying, then, is it to know that the NSA has the ability "to enter and alter data in computers even if they are not connected to the internet?" Or to track websites we visit looking for information "to destroy reputation and credibility?" To leverage the technological advantage it has over its targets, the NSA has also assembled a team of psychologists and other social scientists to develop a model for human behavior it can use to "deceive" and "disrupt" us in our online worlds.  Greenwald also reminds us that our vulnerability to such tactics is even greater because the internet is no longer a distinct and separate entity we engage with for a set period of time each day, but something that is with us at all times, almost an extension of our minds. If, as the Cointelpro documents showed, one of the explicit goals of the FBI in the 1970s was to sew "paranoia" in the minds of its targets, how much easier would that objective be accomplished today using technology that allowed the government to randomly "delete [our] online presence" and otherwise wreak havoc with our personal data?

As Greenwald acknowledges, the most serious abuse of online surveillance technology is reserved for a very small percentage of the population the government decides (often wrongly, the record shows) society needs protection from. If we manage to avoid the government's active interest, the harm of surveillance is much more subtle but still very real. After showing us "the US government had built a system that has as its goal the complete elimination of electronic privacy worldwide," Greenwald effectively uses a range of examples from social studies, philosophy and history to argue that the loss of privacy impacts liberty, creativity and human happiness. (Reading this section of <i>No Place To Hide</i>, Malcolm Gladwell will realize he has missed an opportunity to publish another bestseller titled <i>Privacy</i>). Importantly, even if we're not actively being spied on, the knowledge that the government has the power to observe us at any time alters our behavior.  But Greenwald's most powerful argument for privacy is simply to point out that those who argue in favor of a less private society--whether it be tech titans like Mark Zuckerberg or surveillance advocates like Keith 'Collect it All' Alexander--go to extraordinary lengths to protect their own privacy and the privacy of the organizations they serve. Human beings have an intuitive understanding of the importance of privacy and the cost of losing it.

With so much of the NSA material already published during the course of the last year, <i>No Place to Hide</i> will be remembered for its story of how Greenwald and Poitras (accompanied by the the Guardian's "company man" Ewan Macaskill, whose presence Greenwald and Poitras inititally distrust and resent) journey to Hong Kong after being contacted over email by the unknown leaker Edward Snowden.  The story is gripping and entertaining, but it would be a mistake to assume that Greenwald is interested in it for the sake of spinning a good yarn. He shares the story to make an important point about the "fearlessness" of Snowden who risked his life and liberty to make the world aware of the what the NSA was doing.  After building a feeling of trust and comradery among the characters--including Macaskill who eventually earns Greenwald's respect by demonstrating that he came to Hong Kong as journalist and not as a chaperone--Greenwald creates emotional impact by reminding us the group would soon break apart: "One of us, Snowden, was soon to be removed from the group, likely to go to prison for a long time."  

The last we hear of Snowden is his attempted escape to safety with the assistance of a disguise and two Hong Kong human rights lawyers.  It is easy to forget the origin of documents and information we read online; Greenwald tells us this remarkable story to ensure that we never do.

The "story" of how Greenwald comes into possession of the documents is interesting backdrop for the fifth and final chapter--<i>the Fourth Estate</i>--which raises questions about journalism and the law that have become an important part of the debate started by the Snowden leaks.  Consider, for example, this criticism of Greenwald by NBC's Chuck Bolster, quoted in Chapter 5 of <i>No Place to Hide</i>: 

<blockquote>
Glenn Greenwald ... how much was he involved in the plot? ... did he have a role beyond simply being a receiver of this information? And is he going to have to answer those questions? You know, there is--this is--there is a point of law.
</blockquote>

The language of narrative and the language of the law share a common vocabulary but the principles behind them are entirely different. Although he doesn't discuss such issues, Greenwald would readily acknowledge that he has a "role" in a "plot" (in the sense of a narrative that he has created that was based on real life events).   His critics conveniently point to his active "role" in the events that took place (and, by some, the fact that he is earning a salary by writing news stories) to argue that he, along with Snowden, was involved in a criminal "plot."  The danger for Greenwald--and the opportunity for his enemies--is that an uncritical audience will intuitively agree that Greenwald has a "role" in a "plot" and then project the principles of narrative into a murky,legal context --"You know, there is--there is--there is a point of law"--to reach a conclusion that Greenwald is guilty of an unexplained crime. This may be only one example, but Greenwald has been the target of similar attacks and smears on a daily basis since the publication of the first Snowden story.  

The irony is that calls for the prosecution of Greenwald support his thesis that "wrongdoing" in the eyes of the government is defined by challenges to its power rather than actual criminal behavior. How else are we to understand the fact that many journalists in Washington make a career of disclosing "leaks"--with no fear of prosecution--that support the policies of the U.S government?

Snowden is the hero of <i>No Place to Hide</i>, but it is a story with multiple heroes. Greenwald, Poitras and the Guardian are equally deserving of the label for their part in bringing the material to light.  In fact, early in the <i>No Place To Hide</i>, Greenwald almost sounds like a modern day David Copperfield as he defines his goal (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest">in a traditional literary quest, a hero moves towards a goal</a>) against which he would measure his own success and, more importantly, on which the significance of Snowden's disclosures would depend: 

<blockquote>
"For this story to have the effect it should, the unwritten rules of establishment journalism--designed to soften the impact of revelations and protect the government--had to be broken, not obeyed. The Post would do the latter: I would not.
</blockquote>

Greenwald has been criticized for his indictment of mainstream U.S. media, but his criticisms are well reasoned, and the U.S. government again helps him prove his case. In the second chapter of <i>No Place To Hide</i>, Greenwald shows us how the Washington Post was tipped off by U.S. officials about the Guardian's impending PRISM story, which allowed the Post to scoop the Guardian at a critical time in the publication of the first few Snowden stories. Why would the Government do that unless it preferred the story to come from the Post, and why would it prefer to have the Post break the story if not to subtley control its presentation? 

Even if the U.S. government enjoyed a small victory at an important juncture, a year and many disclosures later it's obvious that Greenwald and Poitras and the Guardian have been enormously successful in making the story "have the effect it should." Greenwald may want the world to appreciate Snowden's "fearlessness," but we should equally appreciative of Snowden's foresight in disclosing the trove of documents to journalists willing and capable of telling the story.
