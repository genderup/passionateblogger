Hillary Clinton's Hard Choices is a memoir of her tenure as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013 during the first Obama presidency. As such, it's entirely appropriate that she spend some time in the  memoir telling us how she came to be offered the position and her thought process in accepting it. What may come as a surprise to the reader, however, is that Hillary wants us to see her decision to accept the position of Secretary of State as the first "hard choice" she had to make. If you read the first chapter, it becomes obvious this is what she's getting at as she gives a detailed account of her agonizing thought process and her repeated refusals of the offer from a president elect insistent that she take it. she However, as if to remove any doubt about how hard it was, Hillary actually uses the phrase "hard choice" when she tells us that she finally accepted the position. 

<blockquote>
The call to service had helped me decide to take the plunge into elected office when I launched my first Senate campaign in 2000, and now it helped me make the <b>hard choice</b> to leave the Senate and accept the position of Secretary of State. 
</blockquote>  (emphasis added)

Characterizing the decision to accept the role of Secretary of State as a "hard choice" is very significant.  Many politicians spend their entire career coveting such a position. This is obviously not Clinton's case.  She was reluctant to accept it, and, as she describes in the chapter, didn't even want it. She had to be begged to accept it. 

In case you don't recall, or can't be bothered to Google, the contemporary media accounts, however, the story in 2008 was very different.  Media reports characterized Clinton as trying to "steamroll" her way into the position, using the media to pressure Obama to offer her the position and "create a sense of inevitability" about her becoming Secretary of State, in spite of any problems that her husband's finances and potential conflicts of interest (through donors to his philanthropy) might cause. Here's   Here's Mike Allen of Politico on 17th November, 2008: 

<blockquote>
“Team Obama, after all but offering SecState to Senator Clinton, is expressing EXASPERATION with the Clinton camp for the difficulty in getting a clean vet on President Bill Clinton’s many entanglements. “The ball is very much in her court, but the president’s finances have been a major point of sensitivity from day one,” a Democratic official said. (“Day One!”) “Given that everyone’s mystified by how deliberately public the Clintons have made this once secret process, the assumption is either that the Clintons are trying to use the public buzz to steamroll their way in, create a sense of inevitability that overcomes those concerns, or that it’s just a matter of time before they … satisfy vetting somehow, some way. Otherwise, after all this speculation, there’ll be a permanent dark cloud hanging over her finances. … But generally the sense among the no-drama Obama world is: This is well on its way to winning best Oscar for drama.”

</blockquote>

So which is true?  

It's interesting to contemporary accounts of what happened (which of course could be very unreliable) with Hillary's own account (which of course can also be unreliable and self interested), but will the truth be known. Is Hillary telling us what really happened (in her mind),  or is she with her account of the episode in Hard Times finishing the media spin that started in 2008?   That may never be known but taking a closer look, a "textual analysis", her Hillary's account in Hard Times (and comparing it to media reports) indicates that Clinton is very careful about choosing her words (and how much time she gives to certain topics) which she also weaves into contemporary media accounts...



Hillary begins her narrative five days after the election in 2008, on a quiet Sunday afternoon, walking with Bill in nature where she was "decompressing".  Although two days earlier (as she tells us later in the chapter) her advisor Philippe had told her rumours that she was being considered for a variety of positions in the administration "from Secretary of Defense to Postmaster general," she tells us that she was only thinking of working with Obama in the context of her work in the Senate where she was looking forward to returning . "when suddenly Bill's phone rang" and it was Obama's voice telling her that he wanted to meet her. [[include they'd have to call her back]] When Hillary speculates about why Obama might be calling, it seems slightly comical (which might only be a result of hindsight being 20/20) that the reasons Hillary came up with included everything but the idea that she'd be appointed to a position in his cabinet, as if the idea was so preposterous (postmaster general?) that she wouldn't even give it a thought:

<blockquote>
 Why was he calling? Maybe he wanted our imput on the team he was putting together. Or to strategize about a major policy challenge, like economic recovery or health care reform. Or perhaps he simply wanted to line up our help for a quick burst of legislative activity in the spring.  Bill, remembering his own hectic transition, guessed that he wanted to run names by us for White House and Cabinet positions.

</blockquote>

Obama indicated in the call that he wished to meet with Hillary, but Hillary continued her ignorance of what ultimatey, nor expressing a desire that she wanted to become S of S.

<blockquote>
Then he told Bill that he was looking forward to getting together with me sometime soon. I assumed he wanted to talk about working closely together on his legislative package in the Senate. 
</blockquote>

Upon arriving back home that same day, Hillary was sufficiently curious to call the same "shrewd" advisor Philipe who told her about Obama's plan for her in the cabinet and that ABC had mentioned the idea of "a team of rivals"

<blockquote>
When I called Philippe on Sunday, he informed me that the media had started its cycle of speculation. ABC's This Week mentioned rumors that President-elect Obama was considering me for the position of Secretary of State.  The program added that he was attracted by the idea of having a "team of rivals" in the Cabinet, an allusion to the 2005 best-selling history by Doris Kearns Goodwin, recounting Abraham Lincoln's choice in 1860 of William Henry Seward, a Senator from New York, to be his Secretary of State after defeating him for the Republican nomination.
</blockquote>

Hillary then writes five paragraphs in Hard Choices about William Henry Seward, considering parallels between herself and Seward, showing us that she was very familiar with the concepts and able to blah blah. she writes it like it was her thinking at the time, indicating that she's only considering herself in the role from an intellectual position, not greedy for it. 

<b>First Public Not Interested</b>

The next day Hillary attended Glamour's Women of the Year awards ceremony in New York where she was asked publically about her position in Obama Administration. It's interesting the answer she gives, and the further commentary that she adds in the following sentence.

<blockquote>
On the Monday a reporter at Glamour's Women of the Year awards ceremony in New York City asked me on my way into the event whether I would consider accepting a position in the Obama Administration. I expressed what I was feeling at the time: "I am happy being a Senator from New York." That was true. But I was also enough of a realist to know that anything can happen in politics.
</blockquote>

This last sentence seems very important. Anything can happen in politics, especially if you let it.  Later in the same week, on the 13th of November, Hillary got on a plane with her aide and flew to Chicago to meet with Obama for the first time since that phone call. This is her account 
<blockquote>

As I later saw him do often, he went straight to the point by skipping the small talk and asking me to serve as his Secretary of State. He told me he had been thinking of me for the position for a while and believed I was the best person--in his words, the only person--who could serve in that role at this moment in time, with the unique challenges America faced at home and abroad.

</blockquote>

 What's significant about this is that after running an exhausting campaign, and stumping for Obama more than 50 times which wore her out further, she was ready to jump on a plane to meet him in Chicago without any forewarning about what the agenda might be. Wouldn't someone in her position (especially considering all the other reasons he might meet her) want to know the agenda for the meeting so she could prepare and not waste time, or potentially leave something behind?  


She claimed to be "floored" despite all the "whispers, rumors, and point-blank questions"


<blockquote>

Hillary, however, After listening to his pitch I "respectfully declined his offer." She explains

</blockquote>

Hillary cared about foreign policy but there were too many problems at home to solve. The seeds of her struggle to decide it

<blockquote>
She cared deeply about foreign policy, but her work in the Senate called her "But I also felt passionately invested in reversing the massive job losses we were seeing at home, fixing our broken health care system, and creating new opportunities for working families in America"

</blockquote>

Two days later, "I avoided confirming that an offer had been made", but she also said "I had promised to think it over, so I did". 

Hillary's account of turning down the offer immediately is significant. If it's true that her husband's finances were a potential dealbreaker, the fact that she immediately turned down the position (and had a reason to -- she loved the Senate) would be a way to save face and gave her protection. If it was ever suggested that Bill destroyed, she could say that she turned down the offer before Bill's finances were taken into consideration.  On the 18th of November, 2008, Politico <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15738.html">reported</a> that Clinton was herself undecided about taking the position, and Politico speculated that this might be just a ruse in case "insurmountable problems" arose during the vetting process, such as Bill's conflicts of interests, or that she's at the mercy of Obama's team

<blockquote>

The Clinton camp’s effort to downplay her interest in the post might simply reflect her need to create an alternative storyline if the deal falls apart for other reasons, including the possibility that insurmountable problems arise during the vetting process, Democrats not connected with Clinton cautioned.

Another possible motivation: Pushing back against the perception that she’s at the mercy of Obama’s team.

“Everybody wants to be perceived as being in the driver’s seat,” said a top Democratic official. “She’s no different.”

</blockquote>


While the Politico's commentary is merely speculation, it's interesting how Hillary's account portrays her as being in the driver's seat, and totally not "at the mercy of Obama's team." In fact, as we will see, it was Obama who's at the mercy of Hillary as he had to beg her to take the position. 

Although contemporary accounts reported Bill's finances as a significant issue, Hillary only gives the topic one sentence in her memoir (compare that to the five paragraphs she spent in her meditation on Steward upon the) and only to say the concern was quickly dispelled. The context in which she mentions Bill's finances--in a conversation in which she's reminded how much they want Hillary for the position--is also significant: 

<blockquote>
was called by John Podestra cochair of the Obama transition eam on November 16 to talk over a few issues and to reinforce how much the President -elect wanted me to accept. We discussed some of the more practical concerns, like how I would pay off more than $6 million remaining from my campaign debt if I became Secretary of State and therefore would have to stay out of partisan politics. I also did not want to do anything that would limit the life-saving work Bill was doing around the world through the Clinton Foundation. Much was made in the press about possible conflicts of interest between his philanthropic efforts and my potential new position. That problem was quickly dispatched after the Presidential Transition Team vetted the Foundation's donors and Bill agreed to disclose all their names.

</blockquote>

What likely happened is that it was a very significant issue up until this conversation ...



On the 19th, of November the New York times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/us/politics/20obama.html?pagewanted=print?xid=rss-page">reported</a>that the offer hadn't been made and that the Clintons were boxing in Obama to offer them the post and that it was Clinton's trying to suggest Bill's activities weren't an issue

<blockquote>

Both sides were engaged in a delicate public and private dance, maneuvering for position and reputation in case the deal falls through. Aides in each camp have grown increasingly sour toward the other in recent days as the matter played out publicly.

In their public signals, the Clintons are trying to take the former president’s activities off the table as an issue, in their view eliminating any excuses for Mr. Obama not to give Mrs. Clinton the job. Some in the Obama camp are bristling at what they see as strategic leaks by the Clintons aimed at boxing in the president-elect and forcing him to offer the post.

</blockquote>

As Hillary moves on in the chapter, she portrays herself as going back and forth between accepting and rejecting the offer, giving her further opportunity to tell us the games Obama's team was playing to try to get Hillary to agree to the position:

<blockquote>

One hour I leaned toward accepting; the next I was making plans for legislation I would introduce in the new session of Congress.I didn't know it then, but I later learned of the shenanigans my team and the President-elect's were playing to make it tough for me to say no. My staff told me it was Joe Biden's birthday so that I woudl call him two days earlier than the eal date, giving Joe the opportunity to add to the cajoling. Incoming White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel pretended the President-elect was indisposed when I tried to call to say no.

</blockquote>

Hillary tells us that she had a personcal discussion on the 20th of November.  Again, she was not concerned about her ambition, but rather her "highest and best use" would be serving in the Senate rather than the Cabinet. She discussed the issue with Obama, but still told him no. She tells us she was impressed that "He would not take no for an answer"

<blockquote>

Finally, the President-elect and I spoke on the phone in the wee hours of November 20. He was attentive to my concerns, answered my questions, and was enthusiastic about the work we might do together. I told him that although Bill's charitable work and my campaign debt weighed on me, I was most worried about whether my highest and best use was serving in the Senate rather than the Cabinet.  And, to be honest, I was looking ffor a more regular schedule after the long campaign. I laid all this out, and he listened patiently--and then assured me all my concerns could be addressed. 

Shrewdly, he President-elect also steered the conversation away from the job offer and toward the job itself. We talked about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the perpectual challenges posed by Iran and North Korea, and how the United States might emerge swiftly and confidently from the recession. ...We were laying the groundwork for a shared agenda that would guide American foreign policy for years to come. 

Yet my answer was still no. The President-elect again refused to accept that. "I want to get to yes," he told me. "You're the best person for the job."  He would not take no for an answer. That impressed me.

</blockquote>

Hillary then tells us she accepts the offer and why:


<blockquote>

Finally, I kept returning to a simple idea: When your President asks you to serve, you should say yes. As much as I loved my work in the Senate and believed I had more to contribute there, he said he needed me in the State Department. My father served in the Navy in World War II, training young sailors to go off to fight in the Pacific. And although he often grumbled about the decisions various Presidents made in Washington, he and my mother instilled in me a deep sense of duty and service. It was reinforced by my family's Methodist faith, which taught us, "Do all the good you can, at all the times youc an, to all the people you can. as long as every you can."  The call to service had helped me decide to take the plunge into elected office when I launched my first Senate campaign in 2000, and now it helped me make the <b>hard choice</b> to leave the Senate and accept the position of Secretary of State. 
</blockquote>  


One of her team members informed the The New York Times <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/clinton-to-accept-secretary-of-state-job/?hp">reported</a> on the 21st that she had decided after discussion with Obama about nature of the role and plans for foreign policy

<blockquote>

Mrs. Clinton came to her decision after additional discussion with President-elect Barack Obama about the nature of her role and his plans for foreign policy, said one of the confidants, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the situation

</blockquote>
