The NY Times has recently been using a very ambiguous advertisement for the film Birdman that was featured again today in its story on the James Foley executation by ISIS. 

The NY Times <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10328969/jamesfoleybirdman_nyt.png">put a screenshot</a> from the James Foley executation video--in which Foley stares, with his executioner to his left, straight into the camera while on his knees in the desert in his orange prison suit--right below the Birdman ad which shows the Birdman (without any textual explanation whether it's an ad or something else) staring directly into the camera. It's almost impossible to look at the one without the other. The Birdman ad almost seems like an artist's close up of the face of James Foley. 

What do you think of the use of the ad by the NY Times in this context?
