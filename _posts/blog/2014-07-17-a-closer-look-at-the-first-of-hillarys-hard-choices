Hillary Clinton's <i>Hard Choices</i> is a memoir of her tenure as Secretary of State during the Obama presidency from 2009 to 2013.  As such, it's fitting that she begin her story by telling us a little about how she got offered and why she accepted the position. What may come as a surprise to the reader, however, is that Hillary intends for us to view her decision to accept the prestigious position as a "hard choice," the first of many that she describes in her book.  That it was an agonizing decision for her is evident from the detailed description she gives us of her thought process in November, 2008 when says she refused Obama's offer multiple times but was ultimately persuaded to accept it after he wouldn't take no for an answer. If, at the end, any doubt remains that it was a "hard choice" for her, Hillary actually uses those words when she describes the moment that she finally accepts the offer. 

<blockquote>
The call to service had helped me decide to take the plunge into elected office when I launched my first Senate campaign in 2000, and now it helped me make the <b>hard choice</b> to leave the Senate and accept the position of Secretary of State. 
</blockquote>  (emphasis added)

Characterizing her decision as a "hard choice" is significant.  Many politicians spend their entire career aspiring to a position in Cabinet, but Hillary, at least as she would have us believe, was different. Her desire was to return to the Senate in New York.  She didn't want to be Secretary of State, but rather accepted the role as an act of service for her country.

Contemporary media reports from 2008, however, told a very different story, that Hillary really wanted to become Secretary of State and that Bill's finances--specifically conflicts of interest that arose from several donors to his foundation--presented a serious obstacle to her being able to take the position. Bill and Hillary, the story goes, used the media to "steamroll" Hillary's way into the position. The following paragraph by Mike Allen of Politico on 17th November, 2008 was widely circulated at the time: 

<blockquote>
Team Obama, after all but offering SecState to Senator Clinton, is expressing EXASPERATION with the Clinton camp for the difficulty in getting a clean vet on President Bill Clinton’s many entanglements. “The ball is very much in her court, but the president’s finances have been a major point of sensitivity from day one,” a Democratic official said. (“Day One!”) “Given that everyone’s mystified by how deliberately public the Clintons have made this once secret process, the assumption is either that the Clintons are trying to use the public buzz to steamroll their way in, create a sense of inevitability that overcomes those concerns, or that it’s just a matter of time before they … satisfy vetting somehow, some way. Otherwise, after all this speculation, there’ll be a permanent dark cloud hanging over her finances. … But generally the sense among the no-drama Obama world is: This is well on its way to winning best Oscar for drama.
</blockquote>

So what's the truth? The answer to this question might be approached through another question. Why is Hillary describing her decision in her memoir as a "hard choice?" Is she simply telling a story about why she accepted the position--a story she'd be expected to tell in her memoir--and characterizing it as a hard choice because it really was, and this is the most suitable way to introduce a memoir about all the hard choices she had to make as Secretary of State? Or does she have an additional interest to establish a narrative of events that would cast her in a more sympathetic, possibly electorally friendly, light as she prepares for a run at the Presidency in 2016?

It's impossible to answer this question with certainty, but it's worth taking a closer look at Hillary's careful description of events and her thought process from Sunday November 9, 2008--five days after the election--until she tells us she communicated her acceptance to Obama  on November 21, 2008. Hillary devotes two sections of the first chapter in her memoir, titled <i>A Team of Rivals</i>, to the topic: 24 paragraphs, 2883 words in total.  

Her account begins on a Sunday afternoon five days after the election in 2008--November 9, 2008--when she's "decompressing" with Bill on a walk near their home in Westchester. Hillary felt liberated because the election was over and, after campaigning exhaustively for Obama  during the Presidential race, she says she wanted "get back to [her] job in the Senate." Then Bill's phone rings. It's Obama's voice. Bill tells him they'll have to call back after their walk. Bill and Hillary then begin to speculate about why Obama might have called.

Although two days earlier on the 7th of November (as she tells us later in the chapter) her advisor Philippe had told her rumours that she was being considered for a variety of positions in Obama's administration-- "from Secretary of Defense to Postmaster general"--Hillary thought that speculation was ridiculous, and so when speculating about why Obama might have called Bill that day (on the 9th), she and Bill considered everything except the possibility that Obama wanted her to work for him in his administration:
 
<blockquote>
Why was he calling? Maybe he wanted our imput on the team he was putting together. Or to strategize about a major policy challenge, like economic recovery or health care reform. Or perhaps he simply wanted to line up our help for a quick burst of legislative activity in the spring.  Bill, remembering his own hectic transition, guessed that he wanted to run names by us for White House and Cabinet positions.
</blockquote>

During their conversation later in the day, Obama "picked [Bill's] brain" about a possible economic team to tackle the financial crisis, then says he wanted to "get together" with Hillary soon, but without explaining why:  

<blockquote>
Then he told Bill that he was looking forward to getting together with me sometime soon. I assumed he wanted to talk about working closely together on his legislative package in the Senate. 
</blockquote>

So, at this point in time, Hillary didn't want a position in his Cabinet, and she didn't seem to think Obama wanted to offer her one either. 

While Bill obviously didn't think to ask Obama about why he wanted to get together with Hillary, Hillary was sufficiently curious after his phone call with Obama for her to call her "shrewd" advisor Philipe.  This is what Philippe told her on the 9th:

<blockquote>
When I called Philippe on Sunday, he informed me that the media had started its cycle of speculation. ABC's This Week mentioned rumors that President-elect Obama was considering me for the position of Secretary of State.  The program added that he was attracted by the idea of having a "team of rivals" in the Cabinet, an allusion to the 2005 best-selling history by Doris Kearns Goodwin, recounting Abraham Lincoln's choice in 1860 of William Henry Seward, a Senator from New York, to be his Secretary of State after defeating him for the Republican nomination.
</blockquote>

In so far as it relates to a possible impact it could have on her future, Hillary doesn't show any interest or emotion in this news--which she implicitly discredits by describing it as part of the "media's cycle of speculation."  However, she is very intrigued by the reference to the bestseller <i>A Team of Rivals</i>--a book she knew very well--and the figure of William Henry Seward. She spends four more paragraphs in her memoir considering the many parallels between her life and Seward's. Some of them are substantive (like them both being the governor of New York) with others more incidental (such as Hillary having visited Seward's home in New York, and spent time in Alaska, which Seward purchased from Russia for the United States). After going through this lengthy and detailed comparison--which Hillary makes clear was her thought process at the time of hearing the speculation from her advisor--Hillary tells us she had a feeling that "Seward's ghost was following her." So now it seems inevitable that she ask herself the question,  "Still, I had to ask myself, it the President-elect asked me to serve, was it pure folly to abandon the Senate and my entire domestic agenda for a short-term assignment at State?"  

From a rhetorical perspective, these five paragraphs are very effective. They allow Hillary to implicitly deny an interest in the "news" by dismissing it as arising out of "the media's cycle of speculation" but at the same time the news invites her to consider the possibility of accepting such a position--and to prepare the reader for a shift in her thinking about it--by exploring the parallels between her life and Seward's: would she, like he did, take the same position in her rival's cabinet?

The next day, on Monday the 10th of November, Hillary attends Glamour's Women of the Year awards ceremony in New York where she was asked about her interest in working in the Obama Administration:

<blockquote>
On the Monday the 10th a reporter at Glamour's Women of the Year awards ceremony in New York City asked me on my way into the event whether I would consider accepting a position in the Obama Administration. I expressed what I was feeling at the time: "I am happy being a Senator from New York." That was true. But I was also enough of a realist to know that anything can happen in politics.
</blockquote>

Hillary then skips ahead to the 13th of November, when she flew to Chicago with her aide to meet with Obama. She still hasn't spoken with him directly, and she still has no idea what he wants to see her about.  Is it odd that Hillary--who must have been fatigued from all the travel she did for Obama--would have flown to Chicago without asking what the meeting was about?  Since she had already speculated about reasons why Obama might want to meet with her wouldn't it help if she knew the reason for it  so that she could better prepare?  This is her account of their conversation:

<blockquote>
As I later saw him do often, he went straight to the point by skipping the small talk and asking me to serve as his Secretary of State. He told me he had been thinking of me for the position for a while and believed I was the best person--in his words, the only person--who could serve in that role at this moment in time, with the unique challenges America faced at home and abroad.
</blockquote>

Hillary tells us that, despite all the media's "whispers, rumors, and point-blank questions" about a possible role for in Obama's Cabinet, she was was "floored" by his offer. She had no idea it was coming. She then tells us she declined it immediately:

<blockquote>
I listened carefully and then respectfully declined his offer. Of course I was honored to be asked. I cared deeply about foreign policy and believed that it was essential to restore our country’s damaged standing in the world [...] But I also felt passionately invested in reversing the massive job losses we were seeing at home, fixing our broken health care system, and creating new opportunities for working families in America. 
</blockquote>

There's nothing inherently suspicious about anything Hillary says in this paragraph, but it's intriguing how her decision to decline to role immediately would have helped her with a ploy the Politico reported she might be using. This is the Politico on the 18th of November:

<blockquote>
The Clinton camp’s effort to downplay her interest in the post might simply reflect her need to create an alternative storyline if the deal falls apart for other reasons, including the possibility that insurmountable problems arise during the vetting process, Democrats not connected with Clinton cautioned.

Another possible motivation: Pushing back against the perception that she’s at the mercy of Obama’s team.

“Everybody wants to be perceived as being in the driver’s seat,” said a top Democratic official. “She’s no different.”
</blockquote> 

After describing her meeting with Obama, Hillary skips ahead to the 15th of November when the New York Times published the headline: “Obama’s Talk with Clinton Creates Buzz." Rather than playing the media, as many accused her of doing, she describes herself as doing the opposite: “Out of respect for the President-elect, I avoided confirming that an offer had even been made.” 

On the 16th of November, Hillary tells us she got a call from John Podestra from Obama's transition team. This is the only paragraph in which Hillary mentions the issue of Bill's finances, but notice how the topic only comes up incidentally. In her conversation with Podestra, she expresses concern about the possible impact on Bill's work at the Clinton Foundation if she accepts the role of Secretary of State. Then, as if only because that topic was introduced, she moves to the related issue about Bill's finances but only to clarify that they weren't a major concern: 

<blockquote>
I was called by John Podestra cochair of the Obama transition team on November 16 to talk over a few issues and to reinforce how much the President-elect wanted me to accept. We discussed some of the more practical concerns, like how I would pay off more than $6 million remaining from my campaign debt if I became Secretary of State and therefore would have to stay out of partisan politics. I also did not want to do anything that would limit the life-saving work Bill was doing around the world through the Clinton Foundation. Much was made in the press about possible conflicts of interest between his philanthropic efforts and my potential new position. That problem was quickly dispatched after the Presidential Transition Team vetted the Foundation's donors and Bill agreed to disclose all their names.
</blockquote>

If word count is any indication of importance of an issue, Hillary spent 637 words talking about William Henry Seward and only 41 words on the issue of most concern to the media in 2008--her husband's finances--and those 41 words were only used to say the media made too much of the issue. Hillary's best defense to allegations about Bill's finances is simply to say nothing about them and let the facts do the talking. She says she first found out about the position on the 13th and implies by the 16th that Bill's finances were not an issue. Three days! The issue must have been "quickly dispatched" indeed, unless her whole narrative is a sham, but is there any evidence that it is? 

It wasn't only Politico speculating about Clinton drama. On the 19th, the New York Times  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/us/politics/20obama.html?pagewanted=print?xid=rss-page">reported</a> that an offer hadn't been made and Clintons were trying to box in Obama:

<blockquote>
Both sides were engaged in a delicate public and private dance, maneuvering for position and reputation in case the deal falls through. Aides in each camp have grown increasingly sour toward the other in recent days as the matter played out publicly.

In their public signals, the Clintons are trying to take the former president’s activities off the table as an issue, in their view eliminating any excuses for Mr. Obama not to give Mrs. Clinton the job. Some in the Obama camp are bristling at what they see as strategic leaks by the Clintons aimed at boxing in the president-elect and forcing him to offer the post.
</blockquote>

Hillary's narrative contradicts these reports completely.  Hillary portrays Obama's aides as doing everything in their power--even resorting to pranks, and conspiring with her own team against her--to get her to accept the postion.  This seems contrived but on what basis can we say it is?  If Hillary wants the reader to believe that her change of mind about the position was a gradual and considered, she helps achieve that by letting us know her aides wanted her to take the position before she did. They might have wanted her to jump at the position, but she was more careful in her decision making, a good quality for a future president!:  
 
<blockquote>
One hour I leaned toward accepting; the next I was making plans for legislation I would introduce in the new session of Congress.I didn't know it then, but I later learned of the shenanigans my team and the President-elect's were playing to make it tough for me to say no. My staff told me it was Joe Biden's birthday so that I would call him two days earlier than the eal date, giving Joe the opportunity to add to the cajoling. Incoming White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel pretended the President-elect was indisposed when I tried to call to say no.
</blockquote>

As the narrative moves towards its climax, the aides move off stage and the story focusses on the two principal characters, Hillary and Obama, and their late night conversation on November 20th, the first time they had spoken since the 13th:

<blockquote>

Finally, the President-elect and I spoke on the phone in the wee hours of November 20. He was attentive to my concerns, answered my questions, and was enthusiastic about the work we might do together. I told him that although Bill's charitable work and my campaign debt weighed on me, I was most worried about whether my highest and best use was serving in the Senate rather than the Cabinet.  And, to be honest, I was looking for a more regular schedule after the long campaign. I laid all this out, and he listened patiently--and then assured me all my concerns could be addressed. 

Shrewdly, he President-elect also steered the conversation away from the job offer and toward the job itself. We talked about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the perpectual challenges posed by Iran and North Korea, and how the United States might emerge swiftly and confidently from the recession. ...We were laying the groundwork for a shared agenda that would guide American foreign policy for years to come. 

Yet my answer was still no. The President-elect again refused to accept that. "I want to get to yes," he told me. "You're the best person for the job."  He would not take no for an answer. That impressed me.

</blockquote>

Hillary, subservient to no one, makes her decision alone and tells us she accepts out of a desire to serve. She didn't <i>want</i> the position: 

<blockquote>

Finally, I kept returning to a simple idea: When your President asks you to serve, you should say yes. As much as I loved my work in the Senate and believed I had more to contribute there, he said he needed me in the State Department. My father served in the Navy in World War II, training young sailors to go off to fight in the Pacific. And although he often grumbled about the decisions various Presidents made in Washington, he and my mother instilled in me a deep sense of duty and service. It was reinforced by my family's Methodist faith, which taught us, "Do all the good you can, at all the times youc an, to all the people you can. as long as every you can."  The call to service had helped me decide to take the plunge into elected office when I launched my first Senate campaign in 2000, and now it helped me make the <b>hard choice</b> to leave the Senate and accept the position of Secretary of State. 
</blockquote>  

And the rest is history. 

These 24 paragraphs are a brilliant piece of writing. At every step of the way, Hillary tells a story that is open to attack, second guessing and questions about things she says and doesn't say, but these questions only arise if the reader starts from a position that she has something to hide. The version presented by Hillary is so at odds with the sequence of events reported by the media that the reader's left in a position where you either believe her or you don't, and if you don't, then of course you're going to view her story skeptically and there's nothing she can do about it. Her memoir isn't the place to defend herself against media speculation, rumor and innuendo. She's just telling a story about how she became Secretary of State and that it was a very hard decision to make. Or was it?
