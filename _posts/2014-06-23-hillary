Hillary not mentioned in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/11/03/rumor-mill-what-could-an_n_140777.html"> this article</a>

Hillary makes the decision, the first of her "hard choices" in the book. The contemporary media reported her team full of drama trying to protect her image in case everything fell through with the vetting process, and she describes it now as her being in the driver seat and the decision was totally substantive about her best and highest purpose was serving in the senate.

Five days after the election in 2008, on a quiet Sunday afternoon, Hillary was decompressing with Bill in nature. At this point in time, she claims to be totally ignorant of a future role in Obama's administration, thinking only of working with Obama in the context of her work in the Senate, when suddenly Bill's phone rang and it was Obama's voice. Hillary speculates why Obama might be calling, but it doesn't even cross their mind that she might be considered for a cabinet position.

<blockquote>

Little did I know how close that relationship [with Obama] would become. In the middle of our walk, Bill's cell phone rang.  When he answered he heard the voice of the President-elect, who told him he wanted to talk to both of us. Bill explained that we were in the middle of a nature preserve and needed to call back when we got home. Why was he calling? Maybe he wanted our imput on the team he was putting together. Or to strategize about a major policy challenge, like economic recovery or health care reform. Or perhaps he simply wanted to line up our help for a quick burst of legislative activity in the spring.  Bill, remembering his own hectic transition, guessed that he wanted to run names by us for White House and Cabinet positions.

</blockquote>

Of course, there had been speculation in the media before then that Hillary might be considered, and she had been openly asked about her desire to work in the cabinet. As she admits in Hard Choices, her own spokesman Philippe Reines who told her about the media speculation

<blockquote>

Philippe had told me two days earlier about rumors that I would be named everything from Secretary of Defense to Postmaster General, but he had confidently predicted, "He's going to offer you Secretary of State.""That's ridiculous!" I responded immediately

</blockquote>

Yes, so even though the idea had been put in front of her, she didn't think of it while walking with Bill. It must have decomprssed out of her mind.

When Obama told Bill they were interested in getting together with Hillary, she wrongly assumed what it was about

<blockquote>

Then he told Bill that he was looking forward to getting together with me sometime soon. I assumed he wanted to talk about working closely together on his legislative package in the Senate. 

</blockquote>
In other words, even though he had to pick a cabinet, she assumed he wanted to work on senate business.

On the same Sunday, she called her shrewd aid Philipe who mentioned to her again Obama's plan for her in the senate, that ABC had mentioned the idea of "a team of rivals"

<blockquote>
When I called Philippe on Sunday, he informed me that the media had started its cycle of speculation. ABC's This Week mentioned rumors that President-elect Obama was considering me for the position of Secretary of State.  The program added that he was attracted by the idea of having a "team of rivals" in the Cabinet, an allusion to the 2005 best-selling history by Doris Kearns Goodwin, recounting Abraham Lincoln's choice in 1860 of William Henry Seward, a Senator from New York, to be his Secretary of State after defeating him for the Republican nomination.

</blockquote>

Hillary then gives us five paragraphs about William Henry Seward. The suggestion is that she knew everything about Seward and the book and was considering parallels between herself and Seward.

<b>First Not interested</b>

Hillary gave her first not interested at the Glamour Women of the Year awards, but leaves the door open.

<blockquote>
On the Monday a reporter at Glamour's Women of the Year awards ceremony in New York City asked me on my way into the event whether I would consider accepting a position in the Obama Administration. I expressed what I was feeling at the time: "I am happy being a Senator from New York." That was true. But I was also enough of a realist to know that anything can happen in politics.
</blockquote>

She flies to Chicago with her aid on the 13th

<blockquote>

As I later saw him do often, he went straight to the point by skipping the small talk and asking me to serve as his Secretary of State. He told me he had been thinking of me for the position for a while and believed I was the best person--in his words, the only person--who could serve in that role at this moment in time, with the unique challenges America faced at home and abroad.

</blockquote>

She claimed to be "floored" despite all the "whispers, rumors, and point-blank questions"

She declines right away

Mike Allen of Politico <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1108/Exasperation.html>reported</a>on the 17th 

<blockquote>
“Team Obama, after all but offering SecState to Senator Clinton, is expressing EXASPERATION with the Clinton camp for the difficulty in getting a clean vet on President Bill Clinton’s many entanglements. “The ball is very much in her court, but the president’s finances have been a major point of sensitivity from day one,” a Democratic official said. (“Day One!”) “Given that everyone’s mystified by how deliberately public the Clintons have made this once secret process, the assumption is either that the Clintons are trying to use the public buzz to steamroll their way in, create a sense of inevitability that overcomes those concerns, or that it’s just a matter of time before they … satisfy vetting somehow, some way. Otherwise, after all this speculation, there’ll be a permanent dark cloud hanging over her finances. … But generally the sense among the no-drama Obama world is: This is well on its way to winning best Oscar for drama.”

</blockquote.

<blockquote>

After listening to his pitch I "respectfully declined his offer."

</blockquote>

Hillary cared about foreign policy but there were too many problems at home to solve
<blockquote>
She cared deeply about foreign policy, but her work in the Senate called her "But I also felt passionately invested in reversing the massive job losses we were seeing at home, fixing our broken health care system, and creating new opportunities for working families in America"

</blockquote>

Two days later, "I avoided confirming that an offer had been made", but she also said "I had promised to think it over, so I did". whether she could do the job


Obama's team calls her again on the 16th. At this time she mentions in one sentence about the possible conflicts of interest that Bill's philanthropic errors, but suggests it was overblown.
<blockquote>

was called by John Podestra cochair of the Obama transition eam on November 16 to talk over a few issues and to reinforce how much the President -elect wanted me to accept. We discussed some of the more practical concerns, like how I would pay off more than $6 million remaining from my campaign debt if I became Secretary of State and therefore would have to stay out of partisan politics. I also did not want to do anything that would limit the life-saving work Bill was doing around the world through the Clinton Foundation. Much was made in the press about possible conflicts of interest between his philanthropic efforts and my potential new position. That problem was quickly dispatched after the Presidential Transition Team vetted the Foundation's donors and Bill agreed to disclose all their names.



</blockquote>

On the 18th, Politico <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15738.html">reported</a> that Clinton was herself undecided about taking the position, and Politico speculated that this might be just a ruse in case "insurmountable problems" arose during the vetting process, such as Bill's conflicts of interests, or that she's at the mercy of Obama's team

<blockquote>

The Clinton camp’s effort to downplay her interest in the post might simply reflect her need to create an alternative storyline if the deal falls apart for other reasons, including the possibility that insurmountable problems arise during the vetting process, Democrats not connected with Clinton cautioned.

Another possible motivation: Pushing back against the perception that she’s at the mercy of Obama’s team.

“Everybody wants to be perceived as being in the driver’s seat,” said a top Democratic official. “She’s no different.”

</blockquote>




On the 20th, the New York times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/us/politics/20obama.html?pagewanted=print?xid=rss-page">reported</a>that the offer hadn't been made and that the Clintons were boxing in Obama to offer them the post and that it was Clinton's trying to suggest Bill's activities weren't an issue

<blockquote>

In their public signals, the Clintons are trying to take the former president’s activities off the table as an issue, in their view eliminating any excuses for Mr. Obama not to give Mrs. Clinton the job. Some in the Obama camp are bristling at what they see as strategic leaks by the Clintons aimed at boxing in the president-elect and forcing him to offer the post.

</blockquote>

On the 18th, ABC news <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/11/latest-on-secre/">reported</a> that serious progress had been made by both sides "t is not yet a done deal, but sources say both President-elect Obama and Sen. Clinton are increasingly optimistic that her assignment will happen."

Hillary portrayed herself as torn, but Obama team was so desperate for her they resorted to pranks 

<blockquote>

One hour I leaned toward accepting; the next I was making plans for legislation I would introduce in the new session of Congress.I didn't know it then, but I later learned of the shenanigans my team and the President-elect's were playing to make it tough for me to say no. My staff told me it was Joe Biden's birthday so that I woudl call him two days earlier than the eal date, giving Joe the opportunity to add to the cajoling. Incoming White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel pretended the President-elect was indisposed when I tried to call to say no.

</blockquote>

On the 20th, she had a personal discussion with Obama on November 20th, most concerned about her "highest and best use" would be serving in the Senate rather than the Cabinet. She discussed the issue, but was still answering no, yet impressed that "He would not take no for an answer"

<blockquote>

Finally, the President-elect and I spoke on the phone in the wee hours of November 20. He was attentive to my concerns, answered my questions, and was enthusiastic about the work we might do together. I told him that although Bill's charitable work and my campaign debt weighed on me, I was most worried about whether my highest and best use was serving in the Senate rather than the Cabinet.  And, to be honest, I was looking ffor a more regular schedule after the long campaign. I laid all this out, and he listened patiently--and then assured me all my concerns could be addressed. 

Shrewdly, he President-elect also steered the conversation away from the job offer and toward the job itself. We talked about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the perpectual challenges posed by Iran and North KOrea, and how the United States might emerge swiftly and confidently from the recession. ...We were laying the groundwork for a shared agenda that would guide American foreign policy for years to come. 

Yet my answer was still no. The President-elect again refused to accept that> "I want to get to yes," he told me. "You're the best person for the job."  He would not take no for an answer. That impressed me.

</blockquote>

Hillary makes the decision, the first of her "hard choices" in the book. The contemporary 


<blockquote>

Finally, I kept returning to a simple idea: When your President asks you to serve, you should say yes. As much as I loved my work in the Senate and believed I had more to contribute there, he said he needed me in the State Department. My father served in the Navy in World War II, training young sailors to go off to fight in the Pacific. And although he often grumbled about the decisions various Presidents made in Washington, he and my mother instilled in me a deep sense of duty and service. It was reinforced by my family's Methodist faith, which taught us, "Do all the good you can, at all the times youc an, to all the people you can. as long as every you can."  The call to service had helped me decide to take the plunge into elected office when I launched my first Senate campaign in 2000, and now it helped me make the hard choice to leave the Senate and accept the position of Secretary of State.

Mrs. Clinton came to her decision after additional discussion with President-elect Barack Obama about the nature of her role and his plans for foreign policy, said one of the confidants, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the situatio
