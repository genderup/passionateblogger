It seems Canadians are really concerned about the activities of CSIS, especially when lawyers for CSIS mislead the Federal Court.

One of the nice things about the Federal Court of Canada is that members of the public have access to Court files at no cost. (By contrast, it costs $10 for a non-party to access a file at the Ontario Superior Court).  However, not every file is available to the public.  On the Court website it says, "As a general rule, all Court documents are a matter of public record unless a legislative provision or Court order prohibits public access."

With Canada's spy agencies having been in the news recently due to the Edward Snowden leaks, I checked the Federal Court database for decisions involving CSIS as well as the Communications Security Establishment Canada  ("CSEC").  There are many cases involving CSIS in some way or another--for example, in <a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/37867/index.do?r=AAAAAQAEQ1NJUwAAAAAB">Farrell v. Canada</a> a former employee  of CSIS (who said he was hired by CSIS <i>to intercept mail</i>) started a wrongful dismissal claim against CSIS after his post (no pun intended) was terminated. Even though that file involves CSIS, it doesn't have CSIS in the docket number. There seems to be only a few files in the public database with a CSIS prefix in the file number, <b>CSIS-30-08</b> and <b>CSIS-18-05</b>. 

When I went to the Federal Court registry to request access to CSIS-30-08, the clerk working at desk recognized the file number immediately but told me it was not available for public viewing. It contained classified material. The clerk also told me he recognized the file number as soon as I showed it to him because the file had been requested so many times by people coming to the Court. In fact, he told me that it was the file that had been requested more than any other and by a very wide margin. He was only speaking from his own experience (there is more than one clerk working at the registry) but he assumed it was the same for all the clerks. There had obviously been a lot of interest in viewing CSIS-30-08. 

There's no way of knowing for certain who was requesting access and for what reason, however, as the activities of CSIS and CSEC have been under more scrutiny in the last year due to the Edward Snowden leaks and Canada's partnership with NSA in the "Five Eye's Alliance", it's probably fair to assume that Canadians are becoming more and more concerned about the activities of Canada's spy agencies. 

There is also reason why this file in particular would be of interest. It's the case where CSIS got caught misleading the Federal Court about the techniques it was using to intercept communications of Canadians overseas.  While the file is classified, there is still a lot of information available in the two decisions, <a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/57186/index.do" target="_blank">one from 2009</a> and  <a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/66439/index.do" target="_blank">the follow up from 2013</a>.

I'll provide you a summary in case you don't want to read them.

In the 2009 decision, the Court reports several instances where CSIS sought and obtained warrants to intercept communications of Canadians. The key application by CSIS took place at a weekend hearing on Saturday January 26, 2009 with oral evidence provided by CSIS and CSEC witnesses. At this hearing, CSIS sought authorization for intrusive investigative techniques <i>outside of Canada</i>, which the Court had already said in 2007 that it didn't have authority to grant. However, the Court now was able to distinguish the 2007 decision ("distinguish" is legal terminology meaning the old decision didn't apply to the current facts)  and authorize the warrants for intrisuve investigative techniques outside of Canada, so long as the interception of the telecommunications and seizures of the information took place from and within Canada. This last part is critical. The Court was led to believe (by lawyers for CSIS) that the interception of communications overseas would take place from within Canada. 

At some point after 2009, it was discovered that CSIS and CSEC hadn't been conducting the surveillance from within Canada. CSIS, with the assistance of CSEC, had been using "2nd party assets" i.e. it had been seeking assistance from foreign partners to intercept the telecommunications while the Canadians under surveillance were outside Canada.  

In the 2013 decision, the Court considered the following two questions:

1.      Whether CSIS met its duty of full and frank disclosure when it applied for a 30-08 warrant in application CSIS 30-08 and any subsequent 30-08 warrant application; and
2.      The legal authority of CSIS, through CSEC, to seek assistance from foreign partners to intercept the telecommunications of Canadians while they are outside of Canada.

The judge found that CSIS had strategically ommitted information it should have provided to the Court:

<blockquote>
Based on the documentary record before me and Mr. Abbott’s evidence, I am satisfied that a decision was made by CSIS officials in consultation with their legal advisors to strategically omit information in applications for 30-08 warrants about their intention to seek the assistance of the foreign partners. As a result, the Court was led to believe that all of the interception activity would take place in or under the control of Canada. 

</blockquote>

The Court also said that the failure to disclose that information was the result of a deliberate decision to keep the Court in the dark about the scope and extent of the foreign collection efforts that would flow from the Court’s issuance of a warrant.
