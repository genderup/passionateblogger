We're making an <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/page-1.html">Access To Information</a> request to CSIS to find out how many times CSIS has obtained a warrant from the Federal Court of Canada to spy on Canadians located overseas (a so called "30-08" warrant).  For the reasons explained below, we expect CSIS to deny this request, which will mean that litigation will likely ensue. 

Here's the background information and how this Access to Information request arose. 

CSIS has long taken the position that it is not barred by statute from engaging in security intelligence collection activities outside of Canada.  A question which remained in doubt, however, was whether CSIS could engage in activities abroad that would otherwise be illegal if conducted without a warrant in Canada. One such activity is the spying on Canadians.   

CSEC, which often works together with CSIS, is permitted to intercept communications to or from Canada for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence subject to certain conditions. One such condition is that CSEC not direct its activities towards Canadians. However, CSEC can direct its activities towards Canadian citizens when it is providing technical and operational assistance to federal law enforcement and security agencies in the performance of their lawful duties pursuant to paragraph 273.64(1) (c) of the National Defence Act. In this way, CSEC often works together with CSIS. 

In 2009, CSIS successfully applied to the Federal Court of Canada for a warrant authorizing it (with the assistance of CSEC) to use "intrusive investigative techniques" on certain Canadian citizens situated outside of Canada who were suspected of engaging in threat related activities. The warrants authorized CSIS to intercept communications <i>provided</i> the interception was done from within Canada.  

As I described in  <a href="http://discussthetimes.com/csis/2014/06/23/csis-file-most-popular-at-federal-court/">this post</a> it eventually came to light that CSIS and CSEC were asking foreign spy services ("2nd Party Assets") to do the interceptions, which wasn't authorized by the Court and which obviously meant that the interception of communications wasn't done from within Canada. As a result of the discovery that CSIS seemed to have misled the Court about how the information would be collected, the Court issued <a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/66439/index.do"> further reasons</a> explaining what had and had not been authorized and it also came to the conclusion that CSIS did intentionally mislead the Court.

Much of <a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/66439/index.do">this subsequent decision</a>, however, has been redacted, including part of this sentence, "The Court has issued more than [...] 30-08 warrants on fresh or renewal applications since May of 2009."  The Court agreed with CSIS that the number of warrants authorizing CSIS to intercept communications of Canadians abroad should be kept hidden from the public.  But why?  That number does not reveal anything of substance about any of the 30-08 warrants, the citizens under surveillance pursuant to those warrants, or anything else about CSIS operations, which justifies concealing that number.

We have therefore made an Access to Information request to CSIS asking for access to documents which disclose that number, i.e. how many warrants CSIS has obtained between 2009 and November, 2013. Since CSIS argued to the Federal Court in 2013 that that number should be redacted, we are expecting it to deny our Access to Information request. However, if CSIS does deny it, we can make a complaint to the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada and if it refuses to represent us on this issue at the Federal Court of Canada, we will have standing to file a complaint at the Federal Court ourselves.  In 2013, when CSIS argued that the number should be redacted, it was alone in court with the judge. If we end up filing a complaint at the Federal Court, CSIS will have to justify keeping the number secret in an adversarial environment.
