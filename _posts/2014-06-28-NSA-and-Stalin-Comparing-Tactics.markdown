It's <a href="http://rt.com/news/merkel-calls-nsa-stasi-408/">well known</a> that Chancellor Angela Merkel compared the NSA to the Stasi after it was revealed the NSA was intercepting her phone calls, but that's not the only valid comparison that can be made between the NSA and the tactics of notorious leaders of the early 20th century. 

As is evident from comparing passages of <i>No Place to Hide</i> with material from Timothy Snyder's excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Bloodlands-Europe-Between-Hitler-Stalin/dp/0465031471">Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin</a> (2010), there are shocking similarities between Stalinist Russia and recent practices of the U.S. government. 

<h3>Bloodlands</h3>

Shortly after the murder of one of Joseph Stalin's closest comrades <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Kirov">Sergei Kirov</a> in Leningrad in 1934, in what has become known as the Leningrad murder, Stalin appointed a man named Nikolia Yezhov to a high position in his government to help propogate Stalin's version of events around the mysterious murder of his comrade, which Stalin tried to use for political gain. 

In Bloodlands, Snyder describes Stalin's new appointee as someone who viewed dissent as a form of terrorism and who collected compromising information about opponents to discredit them

<blockquote>
Yezhov, a diminutive man from the Polish-Lithuanian borderlands, was already known for his view that opposition was synonmyous with terrorism. In February 1935 he took charge of a "control commission" that collected compromising information about members of the central committee for the benefit of the politburo. 

</blockquote>

<h3>No Place To Hide</h3>
In <i>No Place to Hide</i>, the key sections of which (for the purpose of this comparison) were published online <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/glenn-greenwald-anonymous-mass-surveillance-governments-nasa-no-place-to-hide">in the Guardian</a>, Greenwald shows how the U.S. government has characterised people as "national security threats" and "terrorists" for the simple fact that they represent a threatening view point. 

<blockquote>
These incidents were not aberrations of the era. During the Bush years, for example, documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) revealed, as the group put it in 2006, "new details of Pentagon surveillance of Americans opposed to the Iraq war, including Quakers and student groups". The Pentagon was "keeping tabs on non-violent protesters by collecting information and storing it in a military anti-terrorism database". The evidence shows that assurances that surveillance is only targeted at those who "have done something wrong" should provide little comfort, since a state will reflexively view any challenge to its power as wrongdoing.

The opportunity those in power have to characterise political opponents as "national security threats" or even "terrorists" has repeatedly proven irresistible. In the past decade, the government, in an echo of Hoover's FBI, has formally so designated environmental activists, broad swaths of anti-government rightwing groups, anti-war activists, and associations organised around Palestinian rights. Some individuals within those broad categories may deserve the designation, but undoubtedly most do not, guilty only of holding opposing political views. Yet such groups are routinely targeted for surveillance by the NSA and its partners.

One document from the Snowden files, dated 3 October 2012, chillingly underscores the point. It revealed that the agency has been monitoring the online activities of individuals it believes express "radical" ideas and who have a "radicalising" influence on others. The memo discusses six individuals in particular, all Muslims, though it stresses that they are merely "exemplars".

</blockquote>

Greenwald goes onto show that the U.S. government collects information about its targets to discredit them:

<blockquote>
Among the information collected about the individuals, at least one of whom is a "US person", are details of their online sex activities and "online promiscuity" â€“ the porn sites they visit and surreptitious sex chats with women who are not their wives. The agency discusses ways to exploit this information to destroy their reputations and credibility.
