Gender in tech has been a hot topic in the news this week, with Twitter and Pinterest releasing their employee diversity numbers. 

Why is this sad state of affairs happening and is it going to get any better. Let's look at the problem from another angle, the private tech skills incubators where you pay X amount of dollars for X number of weeks of intensive training.

StarterSchool.com in Chicago graduated its inaugural class this week, with profiles of all its students and teachers. Of the 14 graduating students, only 2 were women. Of the 7 full time teachers at the school, only 1 is a woman.  The cost of tuition is around $36,000 ($12,000 per quarter).  It didn't have any programs designed to promote diversity. 

If you were a woman interested in becoming a developer, would you pay $36,000 to study at a school with mostly guys taught by mostly guys only to graduate into an industry where hiring is done by mostly guys and where mostly guys end up getting hired?
