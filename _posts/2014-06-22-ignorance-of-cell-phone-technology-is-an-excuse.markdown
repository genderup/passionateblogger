There has been a lot of positive reaction in the press and social media to the decision of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeal in <i>USA v. Quartavious Davis</i> for its ruling that the collection of cell phone location information is protected by the Fourth Amendment.  However,  one wonders how long the decision will remain relevant, as the reasoning seems to depend on a lack of awareness about cell phone technology (in the minds of cell phone users) that will eventually change and, indeed, which the publicity surrounding this decision will help change. 

Take, for example, the factual background that allowed the Court of Appeal to conclude that the accused didn't voluntarily disclose his cell phone location. This is the Court of Appeal's description of the prosecutor's submissions at the district court level, followed by the Court of Appeal's decision that he didn't make a voluntary disclosure of his location.

<blockquote>
The prosecutor stated to the jury “that obviously Willie Smith, like [Davis], probably had no idea that by bringing their cell phones with them to these robberies, they were allowing [their cell service provider] and now all of you to follow their movements on the days and at the times of the robberies . . .Just so. Davis has not voluntarily disclosed his cell site location information to the provider in such a fashion as to lose his reasonable expectation of privacy. ” 
</blockquote>

The Court of Appeal agreed with the prosecutor that the accused were unlikely aware that they were allowing their cell phone provider to follow their movements, but it was for this very reason that the Court of Appeal felt the data should be protected by the Fourth Amendment. 

In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeal referred to a <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/084227p.pdf">2010 decision</a> of the Third Circuit Court of Appeal:

<blockquote>
“it is unlikely that cell phone customers are aware that their cell phone providers collect 
and store historical location information.” Therefore, as the Third Circuit concluded, “when a cell phone user makes a call, the only information that is voluntarily and knowingly conveyed to the phone company is the number that is dialed, and there is no indication to the user that 
making that call will also locate the caller.” 
</blockquote>

The Eleventh Circuit's reasoning really depends on what the cell phone user understands about the technology. 

In the <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/084227p.pdf">decision</a> of the Third Circuit Court of Appeal referred to by the Eleventh Circuit, there is reference to an FCC order requiring carriers to have, by 2012, the ability to locate phones within a certain distance:  

<blockquote>
The EFF has called to our attention an FCC order requiring cell phone carriers to have, by 2012, the ability to locate phones within 100 meters of 67% of calls and 300 metersfor 95% of calls for “network based” calls, and to be able to locate phones within 50 meters of 67% of calls and 150 meters of 95% of calls for “hand-set” based calls.
</blockquote>

This technology seems to be relatively new and, therefore, unfamiliar to the general public. Once it has been implemented and consumers become aware of it, will anyone be able to say that they didn't know they were disclosing their location by using a cell phone? At some point in the fast approaching future, even the least tech savvy among us will be aware that the technology we carry can reveal our location and that cell phone providers keep historical records of it.  One wonders if a court will ever find that by merely owning a cellphone we are knowingly and voluntarily disclosing our location.
