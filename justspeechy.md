Preparing a wedding speech, a lunch-time talk or a standup comedy routine?  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/justspeechy/id885148580?ls=1&mt=8">Just Speechy</a> may be just the (iPhone) app for you. 

<b>Features</b>

<p><i>In App Timer</i></p>
Need to limit your presentation to a certain length? Just Speechy has in-app timers in every scene of the app. You can time your whole speech or just a section. Tap the timer to start and stop. Double tap to reset. 

<p><i> Draft Status</i></p>
Set a red, green or blue draft status for each section of the app to make a mental note of revisions needed in different parts of your speech. In the screenshots below, Martin Luther King Jr. has indicated he's satisfied with the "red hills of Georgia" and the "heat of injustice" sections of his famous speech, but he still wants to revise the sections with "content of their character" and "vicious racists."

<p><i>Re-arrange order with drag and drop</i></p>

Re-arranging different parts of your speech is as easy as dragging and dropping a row higher or lower in the main list. Just press the "Edit" button and swipe left on a cell to make it draggable. 

<p><i> Make a recording of your speech</i></p>

Practice memorizing your speech by making an audio recording as you look at the list of keywords for each section for your speech.
